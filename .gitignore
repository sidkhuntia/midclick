Here’s a tailored `.gitignore` for your Xcode/macOS Swift project:

```gitignore
# Xcode
#
build/
DerivedData/
*.xcworkspace/xcuserdata/
*.xcuserstate

# Xcode project user settings
xcuserdata/

# CocoaPods
Pods/

# Carthage
Carthage/Build/

# Swift Package Manager
/.build/
/Packages/

# fastlane
fastlane/report.xml
fastlane/Preview.html
fastlane/screenshots/**/*.png

# Temporary files
*.swp
*~
.DS_Store

# macOS
#
# Icon must end with two \r
Icon

# Playgrounds
timeline.xctimeline
playground.xcworkspace

# Certificates
*.cer
*.mobileprovision
```

Let me know if there are any other files or directories you’d like to exclude!
